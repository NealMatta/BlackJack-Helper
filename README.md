# BlackJack-Helper
**TL;DR**
- My first Github project
- I was learning C++ and had some code from a college class that I decided to retool to make my own
**Purpose**
This form of BlackJack allows the user to understand the game more thouroughly. The user is able to practice their counting abilites as well as understand Basic Strategy.
